# Autoencoders for Denoising

This repository contains implementations of autoencoders for denoising applications. The `book1.ipynb` file is a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of autoencoders to remove noise from data.

## About `book1.ipynb`

The `book1.ipynb` file serves as a practical guide for implementing and training autoencoders with a focus on denoising. It includes the following key steps:

- **Data Preparation**: 
  - Loading noisy data.
  - Creating training and testing datasets.
- **Autoencoder Architecture**: 
  - Building a deep neural network using libraries like TensorFlow/Keras.
  - Designing the encoder and decoder components.
- **Training**:
  - Training the model to reconstruct clean data from noisy inputs.
  - Visualizing model performance using loss curves.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Testing the model on unseen noisy data.
  - Comparing denoised outputs with ground truth clean data.

## How to Run the Notebook

To run the `book1.ipynb` file, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Falgit1/Autoencoders-denoise.git
   cd Autoencoders-denoise
